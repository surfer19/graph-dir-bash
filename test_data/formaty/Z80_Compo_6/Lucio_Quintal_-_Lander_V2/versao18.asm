; Z80 Assembly Programming On The ZX Spectrum - COMPO #6 - 256 byte game compo
; a Lander game in 256 bytes of machine code, including DATA.
; (C) by Lúcio Quintal (Islander LQ), 30-May-2016. This program is FREEWARE, but original author (me) should be acknowledged when using this code.
;
; Instructions:
; Your goal is to land your Falcon 9 rocket/ship safely on the landing platform (or sea drone as used by SpaceX).
; Press the SPACE key to make the ship descend. Enjoy your landings!
;
; Notes:
; When runing the game on an emulator please make sure "border" view is active since border colour changes to indicate success or failure of landing.
; Due to the limitation of 256 byte code length and no ROM access it wasn't possible to implement proper leveling: increase/decrease difficulty can be done in several ways, for e.g. by changing the starting altitude of the ship and/or the game speed.
;
; Engineering for this ship was based on the works for Falcon 9 rocket from SpaceX (R), so it also should be able to land on a sea drone, as proposed on the game.
